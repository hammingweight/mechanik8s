# Helm Chart for mechanik8s DaemonSet

apiVersion: v2
name: mechanik8s
description: A Helm chart for deploying mechanik8s as a DaemonSet

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that, when
# combined, create a working Kubernetes deployment.
#
# Library charts provides useful utilities or functions for the chart
# developer. They're included as a dependency of application charts to
# inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore
# cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application.
